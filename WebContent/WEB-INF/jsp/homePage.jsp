	<p>Recycling steel saves energy and natural resources. The steel
		industry saves enough energy to power about 18 million households for
		a year, on a yearly basis. Recycling metal also uses about 74 percent
		less energy than making metal. Thus, recyclers of end-of-life vehicles
		save an estimated 85 million barrels of oil annually that would have
		been used in the manufacturing of other parts. Likewise, car recycling
		keeps 11 million tons of steel and 800,000 non-ferrous metals out of
		landfills and back in consumer use. Before the 2003 model year, some
		vehicles that were manufactured were found to contain mercury auto
		switches, historically used in convenience lighting and antilock
		braking systems. Recyclers remove and recycle this mercury before the
		vehicles are shredded to prevent it from escaping into the
		environment. In 2007, over 2100 pounds of mercury were collected by
		6265 recyclers.</p>
